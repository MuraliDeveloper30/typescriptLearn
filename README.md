First Of all, Clear All of these questions,

## What is TypeScript Exactly?

  Today, we will be delving into the world of TypeScript. TypeScript is a popular programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. It was created by Microsoft and released in 2012. TypeScript provides many benefits over traditional JavaScript, including increased code maintainability, type checking, and better IDE support.


## Why learn TypeScript first?
  Well, it's not like TypeScript is the gatekeeper to the programming world, but it's certainly worth considering. Learning TypeScript can help you write cleaner, more maintainable code, catch errors before they happen, and enhance your ability to work with modern frameworks like Angular and React.
  
  
## Is TypeScript worth learning?
  Absolutely! TypeScript is a powerful tool that can help you become a better programmer. Plus, it's becoming more and more popular in the industry, so having it on your resume could definitely give you a leg up in the job market.


# How can I understand and practice learning TypeScript?
  First things first, read the documentation! It's always a good idea to get a solid foundation by reading the official docs. After that, start small by converting some existing JavaScript code to TypeScript, or writing small projects from scratch. Don't be afraid to make mistakes - that's how you learn! And of course, practice, practice, practice. The more you use TypeScript, the more comfortable you'll become with it.
  
JavaScript is a Multi - level Pradigam programming language that offers different ways of writing code. Many developers use it to build large and complex programs, but sometimes they encounter difficulties due to the language's complexity. To make things easier, a new version called #### ES5 was created to fix some of these issues.
After this Es5 
introduce Es6

, why , how to understand , why to introduced , whether now a days iam fine to learn this, once I learn this what is next way what are the prerequistes to understand the typescript

Once you starts with learn any of the programming language
two way to stuck   1 is fear and 2. lazy 3. main CLARITY    }
 My way to learn 
 based on basic this under spend 2 or 3 days

- Its convert regular js script
- Its best way catch up the error in compile time or runtime error
- Easy to Readability
