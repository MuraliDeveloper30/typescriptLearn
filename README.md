# What is Typescript?

```
TypeScript is a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to JavaScript, which allows for catching errors at compile-time instead of run-time, making the code more reliable and easier to maintain. TypeScript also includes other features such as interfaces, classes, and modules, making it easier to write large-scale applications. Overall, TypeScript aims to improve the productivity and scalability of JavaScript projects by providing additional safety and structure to the code.
